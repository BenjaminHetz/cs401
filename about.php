<h1>What is Book-Collectors?</h1>
<p>Book-Collectors is a platform not only for you to keep track of books that you have read, but also for you to find new books that you might enjoy based on what others have read.</p>
<p>We pull book data from <a href='http://openlibrary.org'>Open Library</a></p>
<p>Our goal is to encourage people to read by giving them a way to connect with others who have read similar things and find new interests.</p>
<p>Happy reading everyone!</p>
